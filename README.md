# Algorithms
This is a personal practice for algorithms using c++11, I tried my best to not use c style code in order to train my c++ programming skill.

## Folders Introduction
- String
  - leftRotateString, Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity:O(1)
  - longest common subsequence: Time Complexity: O(N^2)
  - get all longest common subsequences ( with little bugs now)
