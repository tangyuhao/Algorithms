# Algorithms
This is a personal practice for algorithms using c++11, I tried my best to not use c style code in order to train my c++ programming skill.

## Folders Introduction
- String
  - leftRotateString, Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity:O(1)
  - longest common subsequence: Time Complexity: O(N^2)
  - get all longest common subsequences ( with little bugs now)
  - longest increasing sequence
  - permutation of an array with recursion version and non-recursion version
  - longest palindromic substring
  - KMP algorithm
  - get the minimal period of a string
  - get the longest substring which only contains exactly k unique characters
- list
  - big int add using linkedlist
  - big int production using linkedlist
  - reverse linkedlist from index start to index end
  - remove all duplicate elements in a linkedlist
- BigInt: a class of Big Int 
  - add
  - minus
  - multiple
  - divide
- queue_stack
  - topologic sort to look for cycles in a graph
  - calculate the number of shortest route in a graph from start to end
  - get the length of longest parentheses
    - version 1: using stack
    - version 2: using only one int variable
  - convert Nifix expression to reverse polish notation
- array
  - find the definite mode in an array
  - find the local maximum in an array, Time Complexity:O(logN)
  - find the first lost positive integer in an array, Time Complexity: O(N), Space Complexity: O(1)
  - find the subarray whose sum is closest to 0, Time Complexity: O(Nlog(N))
  - find the subarray whose sum is maximum
  - solve the Holland Flag problem
  - get the maximum gap after sorting with only time complexity O(N)
  - solve cantor array expansion problem
  - N sum problem
- tree
  - binary search tree related algorithm
    - find/insert/delete
    - postOrder/inOrder/preOrder traverse
    - generate postOrder acording to inOrder and preOrder
    - get all possible parentheses give pairs of parentheses
- AVLTree (balanced tree, all operation has time complexity of O(logN))
  - rotate algorithm: single left, single right, double RL, double LR
  - insert
  - delete
- graph
  - UnionFindSet (with find, make union)
  - graph class
    - initializing related functions
